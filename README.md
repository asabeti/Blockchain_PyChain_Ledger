# Module_18_Blockchain_Pychain_Ledger

## Application:
In this Challenge, you’re a fintech engineer who’s working at one of the five largest banks in the world. You were recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. Your task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

---
## Technologies

In this challenge, you’ll use the following libraries (If you have [Anaconda] downloaded these libraries should already be a part of your package):

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) 
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) 
* [Data Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) 
* [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
* [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
* [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html)

## Installation Guide:
### To install the Streamlit library, make sure your dev virtual environment is active on Terminal or Gitbash, and then run the following command:
```
pip install streamlit
```
---

## Usage
1. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder where the challenge is located.

2. In the terminal, run the Streamlit application by using streamlit run pychain.py.
``` 
streamlit run pychain.py 
```
3. Once, taken to the new browser. Enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount.
4. Click the Add Block button. Do this several times to store several blocks in the ledger.
4. Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu. 
5. Test the blockchain validation process by using the web interface.
